//simply added a feature section => Now for the feature section to have that clip type of thing we did for header, we can do clip thing or there is nice trick
//to do that same => to the whole section of features, we add   transform: skewY(-7deg); => this will roitate whole section by 8 deg => but the content which
//is feature boxes will also be tilted but we want them straight => we use a new selector => see below => & * would have meant all children or grandchildren
//or so on of section-feartures but & > * means all direct children of section-fearures which as we can see in html is the row containing feature boxes =>
//we tilt that by 8 deg in opp direction and the whole content is straigtened and we get the same clip thing we did earlier.

//can create using gradient only => we have set the gradient to move in 105 direction, then we can also give percentages progress => at 0 we start with
//white, at 50 we have white again and this with 105 will create that partition + we have said that transparency for this is 50% and since image
//is below this, it will show image as well and for rest of the part, there is no gradient and thus image in all glory will be shown.
